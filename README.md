# PLPython Final Project

# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using real-world data. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and insights into the spread, fatalities, and vaccination progress across selected countries.

## Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
- Analyze time trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Compare COVID-19 metrics across selected countries.
- Visualize trends using charts and maps.
- Communicate findings through a well-documented Jupyter Notebook.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly (for optional choropleth map)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run/View the Project

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook: `COVID19_Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb`.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Download the dataset: [owid-covid-data.csv](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) and place it in the same directory.
4. Open the notebook using Jupyter and run the cells sequentially.

## Insights and Reflections

- The United States had the highest total cases and deaths among selected countries.
- India's second wave caused a steep rise in mid-2021.
- Kenya experienced a slower vaccine rollout.
- Vaccination efforts helped reduce new cases significantly post mid-2021.
- Death rates varied based on health infrastructure and response times.

This project highlights the importance of data in understanding and managing public health crises.
